## Installation

Here is the links of OrgCheck's unlocked packages v1.8:
- for Sandboxes: http://sfdc.co/OrgCheck-Install-1_8-SDB
- for Developer Orgs: http://sfdc.co/OrgCheck-Install-1_8-DevOrg

PLEASE install it in sandbox or dev orgs ONLY!!!

If already installed, just go to the same link and it will update the application (no need anymore to unassigned users from the permission set).

For some orgs that have Apex class not compiling, you can install the package without checking Apex classes (advanced setting when installing the app).

Source of the application is in this git repository.
