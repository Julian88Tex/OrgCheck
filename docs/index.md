# Welcome to OrgCheck



## Technical Debt, you said?

Although invisible, Technical Debt has an impact on your programs & projects, your budget, your platform & applications, your end-users and... your business.

Let’s start a discussion about it today!

What do you expect from this reduction? 
- impact on the maintenance of my Salesforce applications
- impact on my technical documentation
- impact on our IT processes
- no additional infrastructure nor licenses!



## Introducing “OrgCheck”

Let customers have an application within their Salesforce org to reduce their technical debt continuously.

Use cases of the application are:
- **Full SObject documentation** from the data model
- **Custom fields** created by the customer and their dependencies
- **Active users** with their profile and permission sets
- **Profiles** and **Permission Sets**
- **Roles** table and diagram
- **Public Groups**: recursive list of users
- **Automations**: workflows, process builders and flow
- **Visual Components**: Visual Force Page, Visual Force Component, Lightning Page, Lightning Aura Component and Lightning Web Component
- **Apex Components**: Classes and Triggers
- **Batches**: Failed jobs

A complementary tool for the awesome **Salesforce Optimizer**.
