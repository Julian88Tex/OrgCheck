# Welcome to OrgCheck



## Technical Debt, you said?

Although invisible, Technical Debt has an impact on your programs & projects, your budget, your platform & applications, your end-users and... your business.

Let’s start a discussion about it today!

What do you expect from this reduction? 
- impact on the maintenance of my Salesforce applications
- impact on my technical documentation
- impact on our IT processes
- no additional infrastructure nor licenses!



## Introducing “OrgCheck”

Let customers have an application within their Salesforce org to reduce their technical debt continuously.

### My vision of this tool
**NO SOFTWARE**
- The tool should run on a salesforce org
  - Easy to install
  - Easy to use and secure
- No additional software or platform 
  - All is in the Salesforce app
  - Not on Heroku 
  - Not on SFDX
- Customer will continue to use it even after I’m gone!

**Available to anyone**
- Source on a GitHub public repo
- Package URL without password
- Support on a public Slack
- One day on the AppExchange?
